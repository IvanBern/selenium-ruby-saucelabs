Selenium-Cucumber Test Suite

To run tests go to /test folder

`$ cd test

And execute cucumber

`test$ cucumber

To generate HTML report execute command

`test$ cucumber --format html -o report.html

P.S.: Somehow file /test/env.rb had been missed by git during commitment. 


## Technical Exercise

### Exercise 1 - Test Automation Goal

To demonstrate your ability to design and implement valuable automated tests.

#### Task

Write two automated browser-based tests for Confluence Cloud, our hosted wiki product:

* One that tests that a user can create a new page.
* One that tests that a user can set restrictions on an existing page. 

#### Details
* Sign up for a free trial of Confluence Cloud at https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/try/ . This will provide you with 7 days of free access to a hosted Confluence instance. No credit card is needed.
* Use Selenium 2.0 (aka WebDriver): http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/
* Implement the page objects pattern: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects - or tell us why your alternative approach is
better.
* Write your test in any language WebDriver supports.

#### Submitting the Results
Once you’ve written your tests, run them successfully and are happy with the result:

* Push your tests to your Bitbucket repository.
* Document any test pre-requisites, assumptions made and any issues found in the repo’s ReadMe file.
